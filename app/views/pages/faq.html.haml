  %h2 I don't get it.  What is this for?
  %p
    PasswordPusher exists as a better alternative to emailing passwords.
  %p
    Emailing passwords is inherently insecure.  The greatest risks include:
    %ul
      %li Emailed passwords are usually sent with context to what they go to or can potentially be derived from email username, domain etc...
      %li Email is inherently insecure and can be intercepted at multiple points by malicious entitities.
      %li Emailed passwords live in perpetuity (read: forever) in email archives
      %li Passwords in email can be retrieved and used later on if an email account is stolen, cracked etc..
  %p
    By using PasswordPusher, you bypass all of this.  For each password posted, a unique URL is generated that only you will know.
    Additionally, passwords expire after a predefined set of views are hit or time passed.  Once expired, passwords are unequivocally deleted.

  %h2 I don't trust you.  Why should I use PasswordPusher?
  %p
    And rightfully so.  All good security begins with healthy skepticism of all involved components.
  %p
    PasswordPusher exists as a better alternative to emailing passwords.  It avoids having passwords exist in email archives in perpetuity.  It does not exist as a end-all security solution.

    The creator has made this app 
    = link_to 'opensource', "https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher"
    and allowed it be
    = link_to 'run internally', "https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher#deploy-internally"
    in your organization, which I have done here for myself and my clients to use.
  %p
    Passwords are completely deleted once they expire.  Additionally, random URL tokens are generated on the fly and passwords are posted without context (what they go to).
  %p
    And for the truly paranoid, there is no way I can reliably prove that the opensource code is the same that runs on this site and 
    = link_to 'pwpush.com', 'https://pwpush.com'
    (this is true for all sites in reality).
    The creator, Peter Giacomo Lombardo, has put his public reputation on the line and I have found no reason not to believe he did this for the betterment of the community:
    = succeed "," do
      = link_to 'Github', 'https://github.com/pglombardo'
    = succeed "," do
      = link_to 'Reddit', 'https://www.reddit.com/user/pglombardo/'
    and
    = succeed "." do
      = link_to 'Twitter', 'https://twitter.com/pglombardo'
    If this is a concern to you, feel free to visit his repository to 
    = succeed "," do
      = link_to 'review the code', "https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher"
    = link_to 'post any questions that you may have', "https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/issues"
    and consider
    = link_to 'running it internally', "https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher#deploy-manually"
    at your organization instead.

  %h2 Could you add X feature?

  %p
    As much as I would love to add features, my programming skills are lacking and owe this entire project to the generosity of Peter Giacomo Lombardo.  If you have any ideas or suggestions, please submit them to the official repository

      = link_to 'Github repository', "https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/issues"

  %h2 How do you make money?

  %p
    I did not have to pay to have this app other than my own hosting costs as Peter Giacomo Lombardo does not charge for it.  In his words, "This is just a pet project I work on in my spare time built for the community.  Monthly costs
    are $17/month for Heroku hosting and any time/effort that I've put in or will put in developing the tool
    is voluntary/donated.

  %p
    I've thought about moving the site to a Digital Ocean droplet but Heroku just makes it so easy.  No configuring
    Apache/nginx, deploy scripts, monitoring services etc...  But in all honesty, that $20/month just for SSL
    is kind of aggrevating."
